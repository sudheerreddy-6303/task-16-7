        At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother Ramesh.[non-primary source needed] Needa marked his debut as a child actor.[citation needed] In 1983, he acted in Poratam (1983) upon being requested by its director Kodi Ramakrishna.[17] He went on to act as a child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989).

        In 1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the romantic comedy Rajakumarudu, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.[18] For his performance, he received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[19] He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi.[citation needed] He also starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari (2001) which he regarded as an important film in his career and the role he played in it one of his favourites.[20][failed verification][21] For his role in Murari, he earned a Nandi Special Jury Award, in addition to his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[19]
        
        In 2002, his performance in Takkari Donga landed him his second Nandi Special Jury Award.[19] He had two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu co-starring Bhumika Chawla.[22] He won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[23] The other release was Nijam co-starring Rakshita.[24] Babu received praise from critics for his performance in the film, with Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed "a routine tale of vendetta".[25] He won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film, in addition to his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[26]
        
        Mainstream film (2004–2010)
        In 2004, Manjula produced his next film,[citation needed] Naani, directed by S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil version New featuring a different cast proved to be commercially successful, Naani flopped at the box office.[20][non-primary source needed] He received his third Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by Ramesh.[27] The film released on 18 August 2004[28] and was successful at the box-office.[29] The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section. This was Keerthi Reddy's final acting performance prior to her retirement from the film industry.[30] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu (2005), co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002 before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.[31][non-primary source needed] It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year.[32][33] The film proved to be a major boost for Babu's career as he received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, in addition to fetching his second Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the role of a hired assassin.[34] The movie collected a share of ₹22 crores at the box office.[citation needed] Idlebrain.com gave it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant as professional killer.[35]Cinegoer.net gave a review stating, "True the film gives an image of a Hollywood base for the drama. Even the taking, screenplay structure and execution of scenes, less talk and more action.[36]
        
        He then collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[37] He received high praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing his questionable career choices of late".[37] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[38] That same year, his next film, Sainikudu, was released.[39] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that "Nonetheless, Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise of letting the warrior in each individual surface, and the fact that it is done with the idea of motivating people to do something for their fellow humans".[40]
        
        The following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi, co-starring Amrita Rao, marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by Mahesh Babu's's brother Ramesh.[41] UTV Motion Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu film venture.[42] Jeevi of Idlebrain.com praised the film's first half while criticising the last thirty minutes of the film.[43] A critic from Rediff.com wrote that the film "is built up through a 'racy' screenplay which is gripping to an extent, but stretches to three long hours".[44] In 2008, Babu provided voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram Srinivas.[45]
        
        After Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for seven months; two months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was unintentionally extended for two years due to several delays. During this time, Babu's grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was worried about Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so long.[46] The film deals with illegal-mining in India, and related environmental damage.[47] It marks Babu's return as an actor after a three-year hiatus in his second collaboration with Trivikram after Athadu.</p>
